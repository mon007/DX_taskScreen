Steps to run the app

Please note I have made this app using expo so that it is easily accessible.

1. Download the project and open in any code editor
2. Open the terminal in the code editor where the project is opened and run this commamd "npm install"
3. Run command "npm run android" to run the app in android or "npm run ios" to run in ios
4. Download the expo app and scan the QR which will be seen in the terminal incase no simulator is present.
